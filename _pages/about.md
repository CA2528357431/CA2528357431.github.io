**Greetings, everyone!**

I am An Cao, an AI engineer dedicated to advancing machine learning through innovative research and practical applications.

I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Applied Computing (MScAC) with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Toronto, where I am honored to be a recipient of the prestigious Vector Scholarship in AI. This dynamic academic environment inspires my curiosity and fuels my commitment to impactful research. 

Currently, I am working as a Machine Learning Intern at ModiFace, where I focus on adapting Vision Language Models for interactive beauty tasks. I am developing an explainable VLM system that modifyies photos while delivering personalized insights in multiple forms as explanations and enables tailored enhancement recommendations. Additionally, I will curate diverse image-text datasets to fine-tune the VLM, ensuring robust performance across varied beauty applications. As a Machine Learning Associate intern at the Vector Institute from September in 2024 to May in 2025, I contribute to cutting-edge projects that bridge innovation and real-world impact. My initial project involved developing a Conversational Audience Builder for Arima’s Synthetic Society. I designed a retrieval agent that dynamically extracts relevant features from a synthetic society based on audience profiles shaped through user interactions with a chatbot, delivering clear explanations to ensure an intuitive user experience. Subsequently, I worked on DiligenceGPT in collaboration with StartupFuel, a project focused on streamlining due diligence for investors. By leveraging unstructured data from documents, images, websites, and search engines, DiligenceGPT generates comprehensive diligence reports with in-depth analysis and quantitative evaluations.

I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2024, graduating with a GPA of 3.96/4.0, ranking 3rd among 120 peers. My academic excellence was recognized with the Outstanding Undergraduate Student award.

With three years of research experience in deep learning and machine learning, I have addressed diverse challenges and led innovative projects. Initially collaborating with senior lab members, I later spearheaded a four-person team on two significant initiatives. The first developed a Text-Driven Zero-Shot Lightweight Image Manipulation model, enabling flexible image edits through text prompts without pretraining. The second created a High-Performance Image Harmonization model, integrating Transformers and Diffusion models with a novel Student-Teacher architecture to enhance performance. These efforts resulted in two first-author publications: one accepted for an oral presentation at IJCNN and the other published in the SCI Q1 journal IMAVIS, demonstrating my ability to translate complex ideas into meaningful contributions.

Looking ahead, I am committed to pushing the boundaries of machine learning to create solutions that advance technology and deliver societal impact.
