**Greetings, everyone!**

This is An Cao. 

I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Applied Computing (MScAC) with a concentration on Artificial Intelligence at the University of Toronto, where I am honored to be supported by the Vector Scholarship in AI.

At present, I am interning as a Machine Learning Associate at the Vector Institute. My first project involved developing an Conversational Audience Builder for the Synthetic Society of Arima. The retrieval agent fetches relevant features from the synthetic society based on audience profiles created during users' interactions with our guiding chatbot and offers clarifications for each suggested feature about the meaning of this feature and its connection with users' audience profiles. I am currently working on another project, DiligenceGPT, in collaboration with StartupFuel, which aims at generating draft diligence report and accelerating the workflow of the due diligence process by both structured and unstructured data.

I completed my undergraduate studies at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), graduating in 2024 with a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. I achieved a GPA of 3.96/4.0, ranking 3rd out of 120 students, and was honored as an Outstanding Undergraduate Student.

With three years of research experience in deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML), I have contributed to numerous projects and led my own initiatives. I began by assisting senior lab members and later took the lead of a 4-person team on two major projects. The first project is a Text-Driven Zero-Shot Lightweight Image Manipulation model that allows manipulating elements in images via text prompts without pretraining. The second involved developing a High-Performance Image Harmonization model, integrating Transformers and Diffusion models. We also introduce a Student-Teacher architecture to further improve the performance. I authored two papers based on these projects as the first author, one of which is accepted for an oral presentation at IJCNN, and the other is published in a SCI Q1 journal IMAVIS.

Looking ahead, I am eager to continue advancing and make a difference in the field of machine learning and contribute meaningfully to society.
