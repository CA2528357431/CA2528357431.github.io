**Greetings, everyone!**

This is An Cao. 

I am a graduate student pursuing an MScAC with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Toronto, supported by a Vector Scholarship in AI.

Currently, I am doing my intern at the Vector Institute as a Machine Learning Associate. My first project involved developing an Audience-Building Agent for the Synthetic Society of Arima. This agent retrieves relevant features based on audience profiles created during users' conversations with our guiding chatbot and provides clarifications for each suggested feature. Presently, I am working on another project, DiligenceGPT, in collaboration with StartupFuel, which aims to streamline the due diligence process based on structured and unstructured data.

During my undergraduate studies at HUST, I achieved a GPA of 3.96/4.0, ranking 3rd out of 120 students. I graduated in 2024 with a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and was honored as an Outstanding Undergraduate Student.

With three years of research experience in deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML), I have contributed to various projects and led my own initiatives. I first assisted senior lab members and later spearheaded two significant projects as team leader. My first project was a Text-Driven Zero-Shot Lightweight Image Generation model, enabling image manipulation via text prompts without pretraining. My second project involved developing a High-Performance Image Harmonization model leveraging Transformers, Diffusion models, and a Student-Teacher structure. I authored two first-author papers based on these projects, with one accepted as an Oral presentation at IJCNN and the other published in the SCI Q1 journal IMAVIS.

In the future, I aspire to continue advancing the field of machine learning, seeking opportunities to make meaningful contributions to society.
