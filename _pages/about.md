**Greetings, everyone!**

I am An Cao.

I am an MLE at the BMO Digital Core AI team, where I develop and deploy robust, large-scale systems to solve real-world challenges. My work focuses on translating advanced models into reliable, production-ready solutions that deliver tangible value in complex enterprise environments.

I completed my MScAC AI concentreation at University of Toronto with Vector Scholarship in AI. During my studies, I completed my co-op at L'Oreal ModiFace AI team, where I worked on explainable vision–language models for multimodal medical and beauty applications. I also worked at the Vector Institute as an AI Technical Specialist and ML Associate, contributing to agentic and multimodal solutions for the fintech and healthcare industries.

I earned my BEng in Software Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, graduating as an Outstanding Undergraduate Student. Over three years of research experience in the lab, I led projects in multimodal systems and computer vision, publishing two first-author papers.

Looking ahead, I am driven to push the boundaries of intelligent systems by building scalable, high-impact technologies that balance performance, reliability, and meaningful societal benefit.
