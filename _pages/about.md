**Greetings, everyone!**

This is An Cao. 

Currently, I am chasing my master degree in the Master of Science in Applied Computing (MScAC) AI concentration at University of Toronto and expect to graduate in Dec, 2026. In order to further consolidate my capabilities of AI, I selected courses like MAT1510: Deep Learning and Data Science and CSC2529: Computational Imaging. Also, I am now doing my intern at Vector Institute, improving my practical abilities and expanding my research scope. As a Machine Learning Associate, I am participating in a Machine Learning project to develop a Conversational Database Agent for Synthetic Society, where I am responsible for the NLP and Vector Database of the project. Besides, I am One of the recipents of Vector Scholarship in AI, which I am really proud of.
In 2024, I obtained my bachelor degree in Software Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. During my undergraduate studies, I achieved an excellent CGPA of 3.97/4.00. Awarded several accolades, I obtained the opportunity to join a deep learning lab to work on various deep learning projects. Researching for 3 years, I strengthened the mathematical foundations of DL-related linear algebra, probability theory, and statistics as well as engineering abilities for DL projects. After preparing myself by assisting senior members of the lab for a year, I started to form and lead a 4-member team to conduct research on a zero-shot text-driven image editing model, which is named “LisaCLIP: Locally Incremental Semantics Adaptation towards Zero-shot Text-driven Image Synthesis”. With excellent results, our project becomes a Province-level project with funding. Further, our paper was accepted as Oral in IJCNN, where I am the first author. Encouraged by my first research project, in 2024, I started another research on an image harmonization model based on the Student-Teacher structure, which integrates Transformer and Diffusion. As the project leader of the team and the first author, we author a paper for the project, named “Diff-STAR: Exploring Student-Teacher Adaptive Reconstruction through Diffusion-based Generation for Image Harmonization”. The paper was published in an SCI Q1 journal, Image and Vision Computing.
In the long term, I want to apply my skills as an ML engineer. I want to lead innovative ideas that could solve real-world problems and contribute to the whole society. Therefore, I plan to continue my research to delve deeper into ML and develop a deeper insight into the field of AI.
