**Greetings, everyone!**

I am An Cao, an AI engineer passionate about advancing machine learning through innovative research and practical applications.

Currently, I am pursuing an MSc in Applied Computing (AI concentration) at University of Toronto, where I am a Vector Scholarship in AI recipient. Meanwhile, I am working as a Machine Learning Intern at ModiFace, developing an explainable Vision Language Model for multimodal beauty tasks. Moreover, I am serving as an AI Technical Specialist at Vector Institute to provide hands-on support to the development of Agentic AI and Multi-modal AI solutions.

As a Machine Learning Associate at the Vector Institute from 2024 to 2025, I built a Conversational Audience Builder to enable users organize their customer profiles in Arima’s Synthetic Society. Moreover, I also worked on DiligenceGPT, offering investors reliable due diligence from multimodal data from different sources.

I graduated with a Bachelor’s in Software Engineering from HUST in 2024 with a GPA of 3.96/4.0, earning the Outstanding Undergraduate Student award. With three years of deep learning research, I led projects on zero-shot image manipulation and high-performance image harmonization, resulting in two first-author papers (IJCNN oral and IMAVIS SCI Q1).

Looking ahead, I am committed to pushing the boundaries of machine learning to create solutions that advance technology and deliver societal impact.
