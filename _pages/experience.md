## **Title: Machine Learning Intern**
- **Duration: 2025.05 - 2025.12**
- **Location: Toronto, Ontario, Canada** 

### Project: Digital Dermatologist: Foundational Explainable Vision-Language Model for Skin Health
- **Intro**: A explainable multimodal Vision Language Model (VLM) for the beauty&health industry that provides user-tailored insights on the various skin concerns with skin concern segmentation masks as explainable signals in conversations
- **Keypoints**: 
  - Employed LLMs for data augmentation, expanding dataset by 15 times and imputing absent text modality.
  - Applied semi-supervised learning to synthesize missing segmentation masks in partially annotated skin datasets.
  - Integrated SAM with LLaMa for multimodal responses of medical text insights and skin concern segmentation masks.
  - Aligned LLaMA embeddings and SAM to ground text insights in segmentation masks for visual explainability.
  - Boosted diagnostic accuracy and coverage by 31% over SOTA via parallel quantized LoRA finetuning on 4 A100s.
  - Achieved a 23% increase in IoU for skin concern segmentation, outperforming existing specialized models.
  - Utilized contrastive learning to finetune an embedding model, enabling chat-based product recommendations.

- **Location: Toronto, Ontario, Canada** 

### Project: DiligenceGPT
- **Intro**: An AI-powered due diligence system that ingests multi-modal information from multiple formats and provides consistent evaluation and insightful analysis in real-time, based on unstructured documents and live data sources.
- **Keypoints**:
  - Applied multi-modal LLMs to extract finance data from uncurated & unstructured documents with 89% coverage.
  - Built a RAG agent on vector database of minute-level live data, delivering business analysis with traceable datapoints.
  - Designed a LLM+ML quantitative company evaluator with 97% consistency, exceeding human expert performance.
  - Orchestrated async model deployment to parallelize inference, reducing response latency by 70% on average.

### Project: Conversational Audience Builder for Synthetic Society
- **Intro**: An LLM-driven data analysis agent that interactively guides users to build their customer profiles through conversation, and provides suggestions of attributes and values in the synthetic society
- **Keypoints**:
  - Created a conversational RAG agent that suggests relevant database values, accelerating complex query formulation.
  - Leveraged LLMs to decompose complex queries into atomic sub-queries, ensuring retrieval covers all specified objects.
  - Solved semantic retrieval bottlenecks by fine-tuning the embedding model, achieving a 49% improvement in recall.
  - Implemented an async streaming backend with FastAPI to maintain low-latency responses under concurrent user loads.
