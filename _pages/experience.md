## **Title: Machine Learning Intern**
- **Duration: 2025.05 - Present**
- **Location: Toronto, Ontario, Canada** 

### Project: Digital Dermatologist: Foundational Explainable Vision-Language Model for Skin Health
- **Intro**: A explainable multimodal Vision Language Model (VLM) for the beauty&health industry that provides user-tailored insights on the various skin concerns with skin concern segmentation masks as explainable signals in conversations
- **Keypoints**: 
  - Performed multi-modal alignment on LLaMA and ViT, enabling the model to digest medical text and images
  - Integrated SAM to multi-modal LLaMa to deliver text insights with segmentation masks to deliver its explainability
  - Applied LoRA to finetune the model for medical tasks, reaching 52% segmentation IoU and 0.15 text Cross Entropy
  - Leveraged Semi-Supervised learning to finetune the model on partially annotated and modal-incomplete datasets
  - Employed LLMs and Unet for data augmentation, expending dataset by 3 times and imputing 2 absent modals
  - Utilized contrastive learning to finetune an embedding model, enabling product recommendations from skin analysis

## **Title: Machine Learning Associate**
- **Duration: 2024.09 - 2025.05**
- **Location: Toronto, Ontario, Canada** 

### Project: DiligenceGPT
- **Intro**: An AI-powered due diligence system that ingests multi-modal information from multiple formats and provides consistent evaluation and insightful analysis in real-time, based on unstructured documents and live data sources.
- **Keypoints**:
  - Applied multi-modal LLMs to fuse images and texts, structuring data from uncurated documents with 89% coverage
  - Built a RAG agent with a vector database and minute-level live data sources, providing real-time traceable insights
  - Combined Neural Networks and LLMs to quantitatively evaluate companies with analysis, reaching 97% consistency
  - Orchestrated async model deployment to parallelize inference, reducing response latency by 70% on average

### Project: Conversational Audience Builder for Synthetic Society
- **Intro**: An LLM-driven data analysis agent that interactively guides users to build their customer profiles through conversation, and provides suggestions of attributes and values in the synthetic society
- **Keypoints**:
  - Created a RAG agent that analyzes database schema to suggest attributes in dialogues, speeding up customer defining
  - Finetuned the embedding model using contrastive learning, improving retrieval recall to 89% in the vector database
  - Utilized LLMs to decouple inputs into atomic queries, achieving 82% question-wise attribute recommendation coverage
  - Implemented a async streaming backend with FastAPI to maintain low-latency responses under concurrent user loads
