# Diff-STAR 
- **Title**: *Diff-STAR: Exploring Student-Teacher Adaptive Reconstruction through Diffusion-based Generation for Image Harmonization* 
- **Status**: Accepted by IMAVIS (SCI Q1)
- **Role**: Project Leader, First Author  
- **Timeline**: Sep 2023 – Aug 2024   
- **Keypoints**:
  - Designed a novel image harmonization framework by integrating Transformers and Diffusion
  - Utilized latent variables of the forward diffusion process rather than pixels to accelerate image harmonization
  - Incorporated an adaptive patch masking mechanism to focus on semantically important area of input images
  - Introduced a student-teacher framework to improve the learning capability, reaching 14.32 in MSE and 39.96 in PSNR

# LisaCLIP
- **Title**: *LisaCLIP: Locally Incremental Semantics Adaptation towards Zero-shot Text-driven Image Synthesis*  
- **Status**: Accepted by IJCNN (Oral)
- **Role**: Project Leader, First Author  
- **Timeline**: Sep 2022 – Feb 2023  
- **Keypoints**:
  - Designed a progressive patch size shrinking strategy to stabilize the semantics of a patch’s CLIP embedding
  - Proposed adaptive patch selection to make the model concentrate on the area with key semantics for the manipulation
  - Implemented learning objectives decoupling which allows the model to manipulate images without pretraining
